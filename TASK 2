I’ve chosen Autonomous Navigation because the idea that a robot can figure out how to reach somewhere on its own truly fascinates me. I want to understand how robots make smart decisions in tricky situations. I want to learn the code and logic behind things like Tesla’s self-driving and smart home cleaners that navigate smoothly on their own.
